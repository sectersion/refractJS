## RefractJS - A completely new approach to proxies, based on the community.

**About the project**

RefractJS is not just a proxy, it is an entire system of optomization to provide the best experience. The system works by _something something_.

**Is it open source?**

This is a tricky question for RefractJS. Most components of the system are open source (which is especially important considering how much we rely on the community), but the one component that is closed source is the Registry Server. The Registry Server acts like a watchdog to make sure that all operations are going smoothly, as well as providing access nodes with IPs of upload nodes. Chances are, this caveat won't effect you. If you have questions, feel free to make an issue.
